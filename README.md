# MARCA-scraper

MARCA is a Spanish daily sports newspaper whose primary focus is on the Madrid clubs, although it covers important news from other football teams as well. 
Majority of the content on their main website falls into the following categories :
<ul style="disc">
  <li>Real Madrid</li>
  <li>Barcelona</li>
  <li>Spanish Football</li>
  <li>International Football</li>
  <li>More Sports</li>
  <li>Lifestyle</li>
  </ul><hr>
  
This project scrapes their site dedicated to Real Madrid news and fetches as many articles as needed by the user.
